# 📝 Generate Poetic Texts

This project uses a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate poetic and creative texts. Trained on a dataset of poetry or literary text, the model learns the structure, rhythm, and style of language, enabling it to produce new human-like poetic verses.

## ✨ Features

- Character-level text generation using LSTM networks.
- One-hot encoding of characters.
- Adjustable creativity with **temperature scaling**.
- Pretrained model saving and loading (`.keras` / `.h5` formats).
- Custom text generation from a random or fixed seed.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for training visualization)

## 📌 Sample Output

> "The silent moonlight fades through skies,  
> As whispered winds in shadows rise..."

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poetic-text-generator.git
   cd poetic-text-generator
